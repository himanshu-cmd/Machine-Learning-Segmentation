# Machine-Learning-Segmentation
Segmentation of credit card customers by KMeans
Objectives of this case-study:
1) Advanced data preparation: Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving “intelligent” KPIs such as:
- Monthly average purchase and cash advance amount
- Purchases by type (one-off, installments)
-Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,
- Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),
- Payments to minimum payments ratio etc.
2) Advanced reporting: Use the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.
3) Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.
4) Clustering: Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioural segments of credit card holders
5) Identify cluster characterisitics of the cluster using detailed profiling.
6) Provide the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for given set of cluster characteristics

Dataset used in this case study summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months.
